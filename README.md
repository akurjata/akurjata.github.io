Custom url homepage hosted on Glitch.com
=========================

This is me testing out Glitch by creating a simple homepage hosted on Glitch and using a custom URL from Namecheap. You could use any domain registrar for this, and then Amazon's free AWS services do the heavy lifting.

Instructions
------------
I figured out how to do this using tutorials found [here](http://strd6.com/2016/02/github-pages-custom-domain-with-ssltls/) and [here](https://blog.fogcreek.com/how-to-configure-a-custom-domain-for-hyperdev-projects/).

The key step I missed initially was getting my SSL certificate issued for my custom domain so it didn't look like a security risk.

Other than that, it's reasonably straightforward.
